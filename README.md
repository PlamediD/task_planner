#### Project: Task Planner app
Task Tracker is a productivity app that helps users organize and manage their daily tasks.
It provides a user-friendly interface with intuitive features to enhance productivity and efficiency.
Description: This defines a task.
Each task includes a title, description, due date, priority level, status, and tags.
Priority goes from 0-3 ( with 0 being the less urgent and 3 being the most urgent)
status can be either 'not started', 'in progress, or 'done' 
Uses Floor for storage

## Features I am aiming to implement 

###### 1. Task Creation: Users can create and organize tasks by entering a task title, description, due date, priority level, and tags.
###### 2.Task List: Display a list of tasks with relevant details, such as title, due date, and priority level.
###### 3.Task Sorting and Filtering: Implement options to sort tasks based on the due date, priority, status, or alphabetical order. Include filters to show tasks based on their tags or completion status.
###### 4.Task Status Tracking: Enable users to mark tasks as completed or in progress and visually indicate their status.
###### 5.Task Categories: Implement the ability to create categories or projects to group related tasks together( based on their tags).



### Additional Challenges (for advanced learning):

Dark Mode: Implement a dark mode feature to provide a different visual theme for users.
Task Sharing: Allow users to share tasks or collaborate on tasks with other app users.
Task Reminders: Allow users to set reminders for important tasks to receive notifications at specified times or intervals.
Data Persistence: Implement local data storage using a database or file storage system for offline functionality.
Analytics: Include analytics tracking to gather insights into user behavior and app usage patterns.
Data Synchronization: Implement data synchronization across devices using a backend server or cloud service, allowing users to access their tasks from multiple devices.
