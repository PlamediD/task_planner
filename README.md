#### Author: Plamedi Diakubama
#### Start Date: 6/14/2023
#### Project: Task Planner app
Task Tracker is a productivity app that helps users organize and manage their daily tasks.
It provides a user-friendly interface with intuitive features to enhance productivity and efficiency.
###### Description: 
###### Each task includes a title, description, due date, priority level, status, and tags.
###### Priority goes from 0-3 ( with 0 being the less urgent and 3 being the most urgent)
###### status can be either 'not started', 'in progress, or 'done' 
###### Uses Floor for storage

## Features I am aiming to implement 

###### 1. Task Creation: Users can create and organize tasks by entering a task title, description, due date, priority level, and tags.
###### 2.Task List: Display a list of tasks with relevant details, such as title, due date, and priority level.
###### 3.Task Sorting and Filtering: Implement options to sort tasks based on the due date, priority, status, or alphabetical order. Include filters to show tasks based on their tags or completion status.
###### 4.Task Status Tracking: Enable users to mark tasks as completed or in progress and visually indicate their status.
###### 5.Task Categories: Implement the ability to create categories or projects to group related tasks together( based on their tags). will limit it to 3 for simplicity: work, household, personal



### Additional Challenges (for advanced learning):

###### 1.Dark Mode: Implement a dark mode feature to provide a different visual theme for users.
###### 2.Task Sharing: Allow users to share tasks or collaborate on tasks with other app users.
###### 3.Task Reminders: Allow users to set reminders for important tasks to receive notifications at specified times or intervals.
###### 5.Analytics: Include analytics tracking to gather insights into user behavior and app usage patterns.
###### 6.Data Synchronization: Implement data synchronization across devices using a backend server or cloud service, allowing users to access their tasks from multiple devices.
