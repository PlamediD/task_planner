## Description of the class Task 

Each task includes:
    - title, 
    - description, 
    - due date, 
    - priority level, 
    - status, 
    - tags.
    
Priority goes from 0-3 ( with 0 being the less urgent and 3 being the most urgent)

status can be either 'not started', 'in progress, or 'done' 
## Technologies Used

## Additional Challenges

Features I am aiming to work on after completing the basic ones ( listed under 'Features') 

1.Dark Mode: Implement a dark mode feature to provide a different visual theme for users.

2.Task Sharing: Allow users to share tasks or collaborate on tasks with other app users.

3.Task Reminders: Allow users to set reminders for important tasks to receive notifications at specified times or intervals.

4.Analytics: Include analytics tracking to gather insights into user behavior and app usage patterns.

5.Data Synchronization: Implement data synchronization across devices using a backend server or cloud service, allowing users to access their tasks from multiple devices.
